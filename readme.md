# Music Note Transformer

Simple note transfer just to fit Chromatic Harmonic's range.

Where you need input file (input.txt) using Numbered Musical Notion (also special version...):

i.e. 
- 1 (normal C Do), 
- \#1 (Semi-scale increased)
- (1) (low pitch Do)
- [1] (high pitch Do)
- etc.

The main file will scan the txt and check possible range to increase/decrease the pitch (to not exceed normal 12-hole chromatic range)

After you decide the shift, the exec will print out the updated ones

Thanks
